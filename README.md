# Work Day Scheduler


## Description
A basic calendar for saving daily tasks and reminders.

## Usage
Each time block is dynamically colored to reflect the current time of day. Grey is for past events, red for present, and green for future. When a user clicks on a particular time block, they can then enter in notes corresponding to that time of day. When they're done, clicking the save button for that block will save their notes. The notes will persist on the screen even after the page is reloaded.
